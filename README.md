# 📘 ChatWords Practice App (Work in Progress)

This project is the companion app to my previous project:  
👉 **Chat English Words Collector:** https://github.com/hoterc/collecting_chat_english_words_app

The collector app helps me gather English words I encounter during chats and conversations.  
This new app focuses on the next step:  
**Practicing the words I’ve collected to improve my English fluency.**

## 🚀 What This App Will Do
- Import collected words  
- Show meanings, examples, and pronunciation  
- Provide quizzes and practice modes  
- Track progress and frequently-missed words  
- Help build confidence in everyday English chat conversations  

## 📦 Current Status
